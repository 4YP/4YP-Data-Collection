This repository contains the source code for the Android application designed to collect accelerometer and ground truth data and send this data to a server for analysis and testing.

It uses BluetoothLE to connect to the ground truth device and samples the device at a fixed rate. 

It also uses the accelerometer to collect acceleration data as the input to the algorithm.

Both of these data traces as well as some metadata and any user notes are zipped and sent to a server. The server location is obfuscated for security purposes.
